# goldStar
Gold Star is a web application I created using React, a Java Script library. On Gold Star you can download goldstars I've designed to share with others you think have done something good or deserve recognition. Another feature of Gold Star is the ability to send in a web form with details to have a custom gold star created and sent to a person of your choosing.
