                                My Dad inspired me to create Gold Stars. When he notices his coworkers doing their job well or working
                                hard he sends them an email with a giant gold star attached. He spends extra time, with his already busy
                                day, to let them know he notices their work. I know his work often goes unnoticed, and I wanted him to
                                get his own gold star. When I thought more about it I knew my Mom could use a gold star,
                                and my boyfriend, and my friends. I wanted people to know I noticed their hard work, and I had the
                                tools to do it.

                                My name is Jaime Marsh and I am a Web Developer. I love to be creative in my day to day life and learned to
                                program as a way to create things to help other people. This is a small project that, with more time, could turn
                                into something bigger. To see other projects that I created check out my portfolio <a href="https://jaimemarsh.com"><span>here! </span></a>
                                If youâ€™d like to work with me on more creative things, message me on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaime-marsh/"><span>here! </span></a>
